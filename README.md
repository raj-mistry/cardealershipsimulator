# cardealershipsimulator

This was an academic project in my first year of CS

This console-based program uses object oriented programming to design an accounting system, 
data structures to store the information of available cars at a dealership, and keep a record 
of sales made by the dealership. The command line interface allows customers and employees to 
search and filter cars by attributes such as company, model, and price.

This is written entirely in Java.
